## Fun follow ups

### Gray out a row while it's being deleted

### Folder creations

Make a server action that takes a name and parentId, and creates a folder with that name and parentId (don't forget to set the ownerId).

### Folder deletions

Make sure you fetch all of the folders that have it as a parent, and their children too

### Folder and file renames

### move Folder and file

### Multiple selection (for delete and move)
